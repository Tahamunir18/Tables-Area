    <h3 align="center" style="font-family: cursive; font-size:40px;color:olivedrab;">What is table?</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>A table is an arrangement of information or data, typically in rows and columns, or
            possibly in a more complex
            structure. Tables are widely used in communication, research, and data analysis. Tables appear in print
            media, handwritten notes, computer software, architectural ornamentation, traffic signs, and many other
            places. The precise conventions and terminology for describing tables vary depending on the context.
            Further, tables differ significantly in variety, structure, flexibility, notation, representation and
            use. Information or data conveyed in table form is said to be in tabular format (adjective).
            In books and technical articles, tables are typically presented apart from the main text in numbered and
            captioned floating blocks.</b></p>
    <h3 align="center" style="font-family: cursive; font-size:40px;color:olivedrab;">Tables description</h3>
    <p><b>A table consists of an ordered arrangement of rows and columns. This is a simplified description of the most
            basic kind of table. Certain considerations follow from this simplified description:

            the term row has several common synonyms (e.g., record, k-tuple, n-tuple, vector);
            the term column has several common synonyms (e.g., field, parameter, property, attribute, stanchion);
            a column is usually identified by a name;
            a column name can consist of a word, phrase or a numerical index;
            the intersection of a row and a column is called a cell.
            The elements of a table may be grouped, segmented, or arranged in many different ways, and even nested
            recursively. Additionally, a table may include metadata, annotations, a header,a footer or other
            ancillary features.</b></p>
    <h4 align="center" style="font-family: cursive; font-size:40px;color:black;">simple table</h4>
    <p align="center">The following illustrates a simple table with three columns and nine rows. The first row is not
        counted, because
        it is only used to display the column names. This is called a "header row".</p>

        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>

    <h4 align="center" style="font-family: cursive; font-size:40px;color:black;">Multi-dimensional Table</h4>
    <p align="center">The concept of dimension is also a part of basic terminology.[7] Any "simple" table can be
        represented as a "multi-dimensional" table by normalizing the data values into ordered hierarchies. A common
        example of such a table is a multiplication table.</p><br>
    <p align="center"> Multi-dimensional tables, each cell in the body of the table (and the value of that cell)
        relates to the values
        at the beginnings of the column (i.e. the header), the row, and other structures in more complex tables. This is
        an injective relation: each combination of the values of the headers row (row 0, for lack of a better term) and
        the headers column (column 0 for lack of a better term) is related to a unique cell in the table:

        Column 1 and row 1 will only correspond to cell (1,1);
        Column 1 and row 2 will only correspond to cell (2,1) etc.
        The first column often presents information dimension description by which the rest of the table is navigated.
        This column is called "stub column". Tables may contain three or multiple dimensions and can be classified by
        the number of dimensions. Multi-dimensional tables may have super-rows - rows that describe additional
        dimensions for the rows that are presented below that row and are usually grouped in a tree-like structure. This
        structure is typically visually presented with an appropriate number of white spaces in front of each stub's
        label.

        In literature tables often present numerical values, cumulative statistics, categorical values, and at times
        parallel descriptions in form of text.They can condense large amount of information to a limited space and
        therefore they are popular in scientific literature in many fields of study.</p>
